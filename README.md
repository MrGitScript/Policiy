# Policy
My policies for my scripting...
All of my scriptings are allowed to be used but you cannot take credit for any scripts besides the Simple Snowman Challenge and the Hoppy-Beaver script. But I allow my scripts on Youtube (other medias) and anywhere you want. Please note though as well that, any marketing of my scripts are not allowed (WHAT SO EVER) and if you use my scripts on any medias at least site your source to any scripts that are mine...
Any violaters of policy will be unable to use my scripts (Keep That In Note)...
Without a further-of-do you can use my scripts just according to my policies, have fun...
